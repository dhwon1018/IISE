# IISE

Files for public sharing in the manuscript, entiled by "Exact Solution Approaches for the k-Cardinality Tree Problem".
Depending on the ways of data generation, the data is firstly catergorized into 'dense' and 'large'.

Due to the upload sizing limitations, I uploaded the files separately. 

1. Dense data set
- Dense1.zip  / Dense2.zip
- Dense1 is generated by the random graph creation method 1
- Dense2 is generated by the random graph creation method 2
- It include four different pairs of nodes and edge densities such as (100,0.25), (150, 0.50), (200, 0.75), and (500,0.99)
- For each configuration, there are 20 replications 
- Each file is respresented at gX_YYY_ZZZ_#R.txt where X=method indicator, YYY=size of nodes, ZZZ=edge density, and R=index of replications

2. Large data set
- All files starting with either 'lg1' or 'lg2'
- 'lg1' indicate that the large graphs are generated by the random graph creation method 1
- 'lg2' indicate that the large graphs are generated by the random graph creation method 2
- Each file is respresented at lgX_YYY_ZZZ_#R.txt where X=method indicator, YYY=size of nodes, ZZZ=edge density, and R=index of replications
